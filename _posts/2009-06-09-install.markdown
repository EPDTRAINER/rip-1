Installing Rip
==============

Installing Rip is as simple as

    $ sudo gem install rip

Verify it worked with the `check` command.

    $ rip check
    All systems go.

Without Rubygems
----------------

Don't have Rubygems installed? Never fear! You can install Rip from a
zip quite simply.

    $ wget http://github.com/defunkt/rip/zipball/v0.0.2
    $ unzip defunkt-rip<TAB>
    $ cd defunkt-rip<TAB>
    $ sudo ruby setup.rb

Development
-----------

Development of Rip happens at
[GitHub](http://github.com/defunkt/rip). You can follow along by
watching or cloning the repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/defunkt/rip
    $ cd rip
    $ sudo ruby setup.rb

You'll also want the development dependencies. They can be found
in
[test/dev.rip](https://github.com/defunkt/rip/blob/master/test/dev.rip). 
Install them with `rip`:

    $ rip install test/dev.rip

Now run the tests to make sure we're all on the same page:

    $ rake test
