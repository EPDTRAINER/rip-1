Rip Packages
============

One of Rip's distinguishing features is its support for multiple
package types. Currently Rip can install:

* directories
* single files
* rubygems
* git repositories
* ripfiles

Rip also has a concept of meta packages - packages which install other
packages. Rip can install any of the above packages over HTTP 
(with the `HTTPPackage`) and has the power to fetch remote Rubygems.

Authoring Packages
------------------

Start with the [PackageAPI][1] module. It's included in the
[Package][2] class, from which all packages must inherit. The API has 
been broken out into its own module so you can easily see which 
methods you should override in your own package.

To see exactly which methods gets called during installation (and
uninstallation), check the
[Installer](https://github.com/defunkt/rip/blob/master/lib/rip/installer.rb) class.

Throughout Rip, bang methods are generally called by corresponding
non-bang methods. For instance, `fetch!` may only need to be called
once but multiple methods may want to ensure the package has been
fetched before going about their business. These methods will call
`fetch` who decides when `fetch!` is or isn't actually needed.
