Rip Packages
============

One of Rip's distinguishing features is its support for multiple
package types. You may be interested in adding your own.

Rip has two classes of packages: plain jane packages and meta
packages. Plain jane packages such as [DirPackage][1] or
[GitPackage][2] are responsible for installing packages from local
directories or git repositories, respectively.

Meta packages such as [HTTPPackage][3] are resposible for installing
other packages.

Start with the [PackageAPI][4] module. This module is included in
the [Package][5] class, which all packages should inherit from.

The API has been broken out into its own module so you can easily see
which methods you should override in your own package.

Throughout Rip, bang methods are generally called by corresponding
non-bang methods. For instance, `fetch!` may only need to be called
once but multiple methods may want to ensure the package has been
fetched before going about their business. These methods will call
`fetch` who decides when `fetch!` is or isn't actually needed.
