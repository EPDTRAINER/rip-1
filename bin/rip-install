# Usage: rip-install PATH
# Installs a library into $RIPDIR/$RIPENV
#
# Steps:
#   Infers the current version
#   Reads $RIPDIR/$RIPENV/$RIPENV.ripenv
#   Fails if PATH is already installed at a different version
#   Reads PATH/deps.rip
#   Calls rip-fetch on each dependency
#   Repeats for each dependency's deps.rip
#   Creates dependency mapping in memory
#   Checks for version mismatch between memory and ripenv
#   Fails if any mismatch detected
#   Copies PATH/lib/* PATH/bin/* and PATH/man/* to $RIPDIR/$RIPENV
#   Stores version, dependency, and files installed information in
#   $RIPDIR/$RIPENV/$RIPENV.ripenv
