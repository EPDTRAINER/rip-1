# Usage: rip-package URL
#
# Downloads the package at URL to $RIPDIR/.packages using the appropriate
# transfer mechanism. Stores the package as PACKAGE-md5 where md5 is
# the hash of the URL from which it was retrieved.
#
# Prints the full path to the fetched package to standard out.
#
# Accepted transports:
#   git
#   hg
#   bzr
#   svn
#   curl + tar xzf
#   curl + tar xjf
#
# Works like this:
#
#  rip-package git://github/foo.git v1.0
#  |-- rip-fetch git://github/foo.git
#  |-- rip-unpack .rip/.cache/foo-123abc
#  |-- rip-build .rip/.packages/foo-123abc
#  |-- (Write rip metadata to package dir)
#  `-- return .rip/.packages/foo-123abc
