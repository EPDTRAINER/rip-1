rip-create(1) -- create ripenv
==============================

## SYNOPSIS

`rip-create` RIPENV

## DESCRIPTION

`rip-create` creates a rip directory structure for a ripenv, assuming
$RIPDIR is set and exists. It also activates the newly created ripenv
by setting the `active` symlink.

You should not use `rip-create` directly but instead `rip-env -c`.

See rip-env(1) for more information on ripenvs and their structure.
